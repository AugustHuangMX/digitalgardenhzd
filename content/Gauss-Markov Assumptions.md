# Tell It by Myself...

It is also called *Crucial Assumptions*

$Cov(X,u)=0$

- Zero Conditional Mean

$E(u|X)=0$, $u$ has 0 expectation

- Spherical Disturbance ( Homoscedasticity ) 同方差假设

$Var(u|X)=\sigma ^2I$

Why do we set these conditions?

Because the OLS has statistical features, so we have to satisfy these

How we get $MSE$

$$
MSE = E[(\hat \theta - \theta)^2]
$$
$$
E[(\hat \theta - \theta)^2] = E[(\hat \theta -E(\hat \theta)+E(\hat \theta) - \theta)^2]
$$
