To add the government part, we should add the green part, which means that the government got involved into the process.

## Household

$$
U=ln C+\beta ln(L-l)+v(G)
$$

The aim for the household is to maximize their utility:

$$
Max_{C,l} U = \sum_{t=0}\frac{u_{t}}{(1+\rho)^t} \text{ s,t } \dot K = I-\delta K = wl + RK - T-C- \delta K
$$

Take the hamiltonian.
