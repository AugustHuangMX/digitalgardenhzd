- **What is acid rain and explain the effect it has on our environment.**
*Answer:* 

Nitrogen oxides are highly reactive and will react with other substances commonly found in the air leading to the formation of nitric acid, which is a major constituent of acid rain, and to the formation of ozone and smog conditions in the air we breathe

氮氧化物具有高度反应性，会与空气中常见的其他物质发生反应，导致形成硝酸，这是**酸雨的主要成分**，并在我们呼吸的空气中形成臭氧和烟雾

Acid rain can cause trees to grow more slowly or even to die. In rivers, lakes: 
1. The acidity of the water can harm some species directly.
2. It also causes toxic substances like aluminum to be released into the water from the soil, harming fish and other aquatic (水生的) animals
Buildings, vehicles, pipes and cables rust (生銹) and erode (腐蝕) much quicker.


- **What are the main differences between gasoline engine and diesel engine?**

*Answer:* The main differences between gasoline engines and diesel engines are:

1. **Ignition System**:
    
    - **Gasoline Engine**: Uses spark plugs to ignite the air-fuel mixture. The spark is timed to ignite the mixture at the right moment in the engine's cycle.
    - **Diesel Engine**: Uses compression ignition. The air inside the cylinder is compressed to a high pressure, which causes it to heat up. Diesel fuel is then injected into this hot, compressed air, and it ignites spontaneously without the need for a spark plug.
2. **Compression Ratio**:
    
    - **Gasoline Engine**: Typically has a lower compression ratio, ranging from 8:1 to 12:1.
    - **Diesel Engine**: Has a higher compression ratio, often between 14:1 and 25:1. This higher compression ratio is necessary for the air to reach the temperature required for diesel fuel to ignite.
3. **Fuel**:
    
    - **Gasoline Engine**: Runs on gasoline, which is a lighter and more volatile fuel.
    - **Diesel Engine**: Runs on diesel fuel, which is heavier and less volatile than gasoline. Diesel fuel has a higher energy density, which contributes to the engine's greater fuel efficiency.
4. **Efficiency and Fuel Economy**:
    
    - **Gasoline Engine**: Generally less fuel-efficient compared to diesel engines. They have a lower thermal efficiency.
    - **Diesel Engine**: More fuel-efficient and has a higher thermal efficiency due to the higher compression ratio and the nature of diesel combustion.
5. **Power and Torque**:
    
    - **Gasoline Engine**: Typically produces power at higher RPMs and has a smoother power delivery.
    - **Diesel Engine**: Produces more torque at lower RPMs, making it suitable for heavy-duty applications like trucks and industrial machinery.
6. **Emissions**:
    
    - **Gasoline Engine**: Generally produces lower levels of particulate matter but higher levels of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.
    - **Diesel Engine**: Historically produced higher levels of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides (NOx), though modern diesel engines with advanced emission control systems have significantly reduced these emissions.
7. **Noise and Vibration**:
    
    - **Gasoline Engine**: Generally quieter and produces less vibration.
    - **Diesel Engine**: Can be noisier and produce more vibration due to the higher compression and combustion pressures.
8. **Cost and Maintenance**:
    
    - **Gasoline Engine**: Often less expensive to purchase and maintain. Parts and fuel are generally cheaper.
    - **Diesel Engine**: Can be more expensive upfront and may require more maintenance, particularly for the fuel injection system. However, the fuel economy can offset some of these costs over time.

Understanding these differences can help in choosing the right engine type for specific applications, whether it's for personal vehicles, commercial use, or industrial purposes.


- **How a jet engine works?**

Jet engine 是喷气式发动机.

Air pulled into a jet engine is compressed and then mixed with fuel and burned to give heat and exhaust gas. The exhaust gas is pushed out at high speed, considerably higher than the speed it enters the engine.

While the aeroplane pushes the gas backward, the reaction force of the gas pushes the plane forward in accordance with Newton’s third law. This forward force is termed the thrust.

The thrust is obtained by burning fuel in the jet engine and the lift arises from the shape of the wing.

The large front-mounted fan of a high-bypass turbofan draws in huge volumes of air, on the order of 2400 pounds/second. 
• Of the total volume of air that is drawn in by the fan, 10% of it will actually pass through the engine’s core.
• In the compressor, the air’s pressure will increase by up to 40 times and the temperature will also greatly increase.
• The hot, pressurized air from the compressor is mixed with a steady stream of fuel and then ignited in the combustor to create and sustain a continuous flame

### 中文：

喷气发动机的工作原理是通过燃烧燃料来产生推力。具体来说，喷气发动机的工作过程如下：

1. **进气（Intake）**：空气通过发动机的前部进入。
2. **压缩（Compression）**：进入的空气被压缩机压缩，提高了空气的压力和温度。
3. **燃烧（Combustion）**：在燃烧室中，燃料被喷入压缩后的空气中并点燃，产生高温高压的气体。
4. **膨胀（Expansion）**：高温高压的气体通过涡轮，推动涡轮旋转。涡轮的旋转为压缩机提供动力，同时也为其他辅助设备提供动力。
5. **排气（Exhaust）**：最后，高温高压的气体通过喷嘴排出，根据牛顿第三定律，气体排出的反作用力产生了推力，推动飞机向前飞行。

### 英文：

A jet engine works by burning fuel to generate thrust. Here's how it operates:

1. **Intake**: Air enters the engine through the front.
2. **Compression**: The incoming air is compressed by the compressor, increasing its pressure and temperature.
3. **Combustion**: In the combustion chamber, fuel is injected into the compressed air and ignited, producing high-temperature, high-pressure gases.
4. **Expansion**: These high-temperature, high-pressure gases pass through the turbine, causing it to rotate. The turbine's rotation powers the compressor and other auxiliary equipment.
5. **Exhaust**: Finally, the high-temperature, high-pressure gases are expelled through the nozzle. According to Newton's third law, the reaction force from the expelled gases generates thrust, propelling the aircraft forward.
