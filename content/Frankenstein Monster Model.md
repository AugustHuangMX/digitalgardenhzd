# Setting

Two *upstream firms*, two *downstream firms*, all firms set prices.

For downstream firms:

$q_{i} = 10-p_{i}+p_{j}$

To make 1 unit downstream, you need 1 unit upstream input. Here is an graphically example:

Note: we make the setting that the downstream firms make differentiated products, while the upstream firms make *identical products*.

All firms set the prices simultaneously, and we could get:

## Pre-merger

Since the products are identical, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ would behave like [[Perfect Competition]], which is $P=MC$, so that $\pi_{U1}=\pi_{U2}=0$. (We assume there is no fixed cost)

For simplicity, we let $D_{i}$ buys from $U_{i}$

## Post-merger

We now let $U_{1}$ and $D_{1}$ merge. When they claim to merge, $U_{1}$ would commit that it would not supply $D_{2}$

So it is easy to understand that $U_{2}$ now becomes a monopolist, (see [[Monopoly]]), it is able to set its own price now.

## Consumers 

Consumers are harmed by firms. Due to increase in $P$. So that the **consumer surplus** is significantly decreased.
