## T5 [[Oligopoly]]

- [[Bertrand Model]]

There are 2 firms, each firm produces homogeneous products, and share the same $MC = c$.

The key points here is that each firm *sets the price simultaneously*, the influence here is that the firm who sets the lowest price would share the whole market, finally, all firms would set the price to $P=C$.
