Simply speaking, we could understand this property by:

$$
Var(\epsilon|X)=\sigma^2 \text{ for all } X
$$

# Why is it so important?

Because only when [[Homoscedasticity]] property holds, we could say that the result from [[Ordinary Least Squares]] (OLS) is most efficient (valid).

The accuracy of [[Student's t-test]] and [[F-Test]] are both highly dependent on this property.

By contrast, see [[Heteroskedasticity]]
