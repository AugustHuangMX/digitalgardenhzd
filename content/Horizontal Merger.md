# Definition

A merger involves a combination of two companies that were previously separately owned. A merger may or may not directly result in changes in the set of products offered to consumers.

[[Horizontal Merger]] exists between two or more firms with similar products

## Williamsonian Trade-Off

The model setting:

- [[Perfect Competition]] with $MC$ of $mc^{PRE}$, price $p^{PRE}$.
- [[Monopoly]] with marginal costs of $mc^{POST}<mc^{PRE}$, price $p^{POST}>p^{PRE}$

You could simply understand in the way that before [[Merger]] happens, it is perfect competition, but after that, the market becomes the monopoly.

We focus on the procedure from [[Perfect Competition]] to a [[Monopoly]]. And we could compare the DWL:

The limit of this theory is that we made the **assumption** that before merger it is the [[Perfect Competition]]. What is then should be considered is the [[Cournot]]

## Post-Merger Outcome with No Marginal Cost Efficiencies

Theorem: (We skip the calculation part)

The profits of each of the non-merging firms increase after a [[Cournot]] [[Merger]] with no synergies

$$
\pi_{i}^{POST}=\frac{1}{b}\left( \frac{a-c}{N} \right)^2> \frac{1}{b}\left( \frac{a-c}{N+1} \right)^2 = \pi_{i}^{ * }
$$

We could then conclude that the total profits of the merging firms only increase after a two-firm [[Cournot]] merger with no synergies if $N<2.414$.

However, since $N$ must be an integer, when $N=2$, and a two-firm merger happens, the industry would switch from a [[Duopoly]] to a [[Monopoly]], therefore, in a world with constant and identical marginal costs, [[Cournot]] competition and more than three firms a merger between just two of the firms is **unprofitable** for the merging firms.

The main reason for that is mainly because it is related to the fact that [[Cournot]] competition involves **strategic substitutes**.
