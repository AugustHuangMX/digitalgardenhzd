If $Z_{1},Z_{2}\dots Z_{k}$ are independent from each other, then we have:

$$
Q = Z_{1}^2+Z_{2}^2 +\dots+Z_{k}^2
$$

服从自由度为$k$的 [[Chi-squared Distribution]], which is $Q \sim \chi^2(k)$

The shape of the [[Chi-squared Distribution]] is highly dependent on the degree of freedom $k$, here is a graph of different pdfs of $k = 1,3,6$:
