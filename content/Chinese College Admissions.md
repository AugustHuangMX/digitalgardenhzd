It is a special case of [[Deferred Acceptance]].

Simple recap:

- when $e =1$, it is equivalent to the [[Boston Mechanism]]
- when $e = 2$, it is equivalent to the [[Shanghai Mechanism]]
- when $e=+\infty$, it is equivalent to the [[Deferred Acceptance]]

# Two-Stage Chinese Admission

In reality, students would not only propose the schools, but also major. and there's choice for student to choose whether to accept "major transfer".

## Model

- A set of students $I = \{i_{1},i_{2},\dots,i_{n}\}$
- Colleges: 
- Majors (which is new): $M = \{m_{1},m_{2}\dots m_{n}\}$


A matching $\mu: I \to M \cup \{\emptyset\}$ assigns each student a major such that, for each $m^c \in M$, $|\mu^{-1}(m^c)|\leq q_{m^c}$ if $\mu(i)=\emptyset$

There are two stages:

1. Assign the application of students to colleges.
2. Assign the applicants for each college to majors.


The conclusion is CPM doesn't respect improvement.

The **Rectified Parallel Mechanism**.
