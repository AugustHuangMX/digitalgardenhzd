The [Dynamic Games](Dynamic%20Games.md) is quite different to the basic [[Static Games]]  because it is about **time** . People make decisions again and again 

Under the [Dynamic Games](Dynamic%20Games.md) topic, we can then talk about the [Sequential game](Sequential%20game.md), [[Backward Reasoning]], [[Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium]] (SPNE)

The difference now is that the player moves **sequentially**, these games are referred to as extensive-form games.

- Decision Nodes: A point at which player makes a decision.
	- The terminal nodes refers to the end point of the game, it is also called the "Outcome"
- Branch: A line connecting two nodes.

Example: The [[Stackelberg]] is a sequential version of [[Cournot]], it concludes leader (firm 1) and follower (firm 2)

There is a key concept for us to understand the [[Dynamic Games]], which is [[Information Set]]
