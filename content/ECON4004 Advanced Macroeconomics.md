Modern Macroeconomic model?

- Dynamic 
- General Equilibrium

Dynamic General Equilibrium (DGE) is complicated 

---

# Lecture 1 Macro Data

Two components: 

1. [[Economic Growth]]: it determines the slope of the trend of GDP.
2. Business Cycle: it determines the fluctuations around the trend.

You used the [[Solow Model]] to study economic growth. You used [[IS-LM model]] (Keynesian) to study economic fluctuations.

[[Hamiltonian]]: Only need to apply, no need to prove, just like [[Largrangian Theory]]

In short, we will develop a modern macroeconomic model to study both **growth** and **fluctuations**.

> It is also the purpose to study this course.

## Modern Macroeconomic Model

It features dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) with microeconomic foundation.

## Market Economy

Try to represent Market Economy using a simple graph.

Consumers $\to ^{\text{output (good and services)}}$ Firm

Firms $\to^{\text{factor inputs (labor, capital)}}$ Consumers

In microeconomic foundation, consumers seek to **maximize utility**, and firms try to **maximize profit**. Consumers and firms interact in the labor market, the capital market, and the output market.

> The road to study this course: Microeconomic Foundation -> General Equilibrium -> Dynamic, and this is the Modern Macro

We will study how the different markets affect each other.

## Static General Equilibrium

### Firms maximize profit 

Some notations:
- Profit: $\pi$
- Price: $p$
- Output: $Y$
- Labor: $L$
- Capital: $K$
- Wage: $w$
- Rental price of capital: $R$
- Technology: $A$

- Profit function of a firm: $\pi=pY-wL-rK$
- Production function: $Y=F(A,K,L)$
- [[Cobb-Douglas Production Function]]: $Y=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}$ 

$\alpha \in [0,1]$ is the **degree of capital intensity in production**. In the real world data, $\alpha \in [0.3,0.5]$ (Western countries and China)

Recall the Profit function of a firm: 

$\pi=pY-wL-rK$ 

Replace $Y$ by [[Cobb-Douglas Production Function]]

$\pi=PAK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}-wL-rK$

FOC: $\frac{\delta \pi}{\delta K}=P\alpha A K^{\alpha-1}L^{1-\alpha} - r =0 \implies \frac{r}{P}=\alpha A\left( \frac{L}{K} \right)^{1-\alpha}$

-> this is the demand function for **capital**.

> We could find that when $R$ increases, $K$ decreases, this is the law of demand, which reflects the concept of the microeconomic foundation

$\frac{\delta \pi}{\delta L}=P(1-\alpha) A K^{\alpha}L^{-\alpha}-w=0 \implies \frac{w}{P}=(1-\alpha) A\left( \frac{K}{L} \right)^{\alpha}$

-> this is the demand function for **labor**

Real wage = $MPL$ （Left hand side = Right hand side）

The capital demand curve would be like a decreasing convex c, this is the **law of demand**.

> The lack of [[IS-LM model]]: it didn't reflects the microeconomic foundation.
