Here is a pathway we could connect:

- [[Normal Distribution]]
- [[Chi-squared Distribution]]
- [[F-Distribution]]
- [[Student's t-test Distribution]]

1. If $Z_{i}, i=1,2,3,\dots k$ are independently distributed,
   
   Then we could say: $\sum_{i=1}^{k} Z_{i}^2 \sim \chi^2(k)$
2. If $Z \sim N(0,1)$ and $V\sim \chi^2(v)$, then $T_{k} = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{ \frac{C_{k}}{k} } } \sim t(k)$ 



The reason why we have to study different kinds of distributions is that we have to deal with different random samples. Different distributions can fix different situations. Such as [[Normal Distribution]] is good at dealing the issues when the sample is relatively large, and t-distribution, F distribution, and [[Chi-squared Distribution]] could deal with the situation when sample is small.

It's hard to say which tool is better, we have to focus on which problem we are trying to solve.
