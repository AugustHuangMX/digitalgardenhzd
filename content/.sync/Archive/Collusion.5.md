# Theory of Tacit [[Collusion]]

## Model Setting

- Homogenous goods
- Share the same $MC=c$
- Firms set price simultaneously in a sequence of identical periods. 
- If prices are equal, they split the demand equally.
- There is a *discount factor* $\delta$

> The meaning behind the discount factor: it reflects how you value the money today vs. Money in the future. Usually, $0\leq \delta\leq 1$, the higher the $\delta$, the more you value the future.


### Finite time period

Suppose the $T$ is finite, then we face a T-period model (Think about what you learn from ECON4001 [[Game Theory]]), we can use **backwards induction** to find the SPNE.

So no matter how many periods you set before, in the last period (round), the [[Nash Equilibrium]] would be the [[Bertrand Model]] competition. The firms would set the price to be $p=c$.

Knowing this, the firm would also play the [[Bertrand Model]] competition in the penultimate round, until the first round. Even the $T$ could be extremely big, if it is always **finite**, the only equilibrium outcome would be  $p=c$.

> If it is quantity setting competition, the outcome would be the cournot.

### Infinite Horizon

When time horizon is infinite or it is uncertain to firms, the logic we mentioned above is no longer applies because there is no final time period and we could not apply the backwards induction.

What we do to find a SPNE: *posit equilibrium strategies and check whether a firm would want to deviate from the suggested strategy in any period*, because it also follows the definition of SPNE.

The **trigger** and the **grim** strategy:
